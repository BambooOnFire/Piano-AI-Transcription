# Piano-AI-Transcription

This is a simple Python "wrapper" that utilizes ByteDance's amazing polyphonic transcription tool. The model is not widely-known but it is definitely a powerful tool. In my opinion, no other models beat this.

This repo is just a tool that handles all the complicated requirements and allows you render multiple audio formats.

I plan to add a youtube download module later so users can simply copy the link and let the tool handle the rest.

# Source Model

ByteDance: https://github.com/bytedance/piano_transcription

# Usage

1. Install python3.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Drag any audio file to the **Input** folder.
3. Open terminal and type **python3.7** then press **SPACE**
4. Drag **setup.py** and press **ENTER**
5. MIDI will be exported to the **Output** folder.

# Examples

The Input and Output folder in this repo already contains an example render of Jonny May's amazing Happy Birthday Jazz piano cover.

The output file is in MIDI format and you can use any DAW and VST to render the audio yourself.
